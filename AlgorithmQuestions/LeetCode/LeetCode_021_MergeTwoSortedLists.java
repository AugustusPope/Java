//Problem:
//
//Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. 
//The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
//
//Key to solve this problem
//
//The key to solve the problem is defining a fake head. Then compare the first elements from each list. 
//Add the smaller one to the merged list. 
//Finally, when one of them is empty, simply append it to the merged list, since it is already sorted.
